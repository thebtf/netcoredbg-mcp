# Coding Skill

## Activation
This skill activates when: implementing features, fixing bugs, writing new code, refactoring.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding
1. Read the task/epic specification
2. Identify affected components
3. Check existing patterns in codebase
4. Read CONTINUITY file for context

### Phase 2: Planning
1. Break task into subtasks
2. Identify test requirements
3. Update TODO list
4. Document approach in CONTINUITY

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Write failing tests first (TDD when applicable)
2. Implement minimal solution
3. Verify tests pass
4. Check for edge cases

### Phase 4: Verification
1. Run full test suite
2. Manual smoke test if UI involved
3. Review own code for issues
4. Update CONTINUITY with progress

### Phase 5: Completion
1. Update documentation if needed
2. Commit with proper message
3. Mark task complete
4. Update LESSONS_LEARNED if applicable

## Checklist
- [ ] Understood requirements fully
- [ ] Checked existing patterns
- [ ] Tests written/updated
- [ ] Implementation complete (no stubs)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] CONTINUITY updated
- [ ] Committed with proper message

## Common Mistakes
- **Starting without understanding:** Always read specs first
- **Skipping tests:** Tests are NOT optional
- **Leaving TODOs:** Complete implementations only
- **Not updating continuity:** Future sessions depend on it
