# netcoredbg-mcp v0.23.11

Prepared: 2026-08-30

## Summary

`v0.23.11` is a PATCH hotfix for Engram #448 black-frame evidence repair.

## Fixed behavior

1. After a foreground transition, ordinary evidence capture reuses the live FlaUI connection.
2. A black PrintWindow capture is discarded for exactly one verified BitBlt alternate.
3. Accepted evidence carries HWND, PID, physical geometry, DPI, stability, and foreground provenance.
4. If the final capture is black, no evidence artifact is persisted and diagnostics are returned.

## Compatibility

There is no intentional breaking change to the published Python API or CLI.
